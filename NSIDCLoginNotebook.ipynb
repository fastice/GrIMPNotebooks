This Notebook will set up that authentication so that the process happens automatically when a Notebook or QGIS accesses those files. In particular, it will create a cookie file (`.grimp_download_cookiejar.txt`) in the user's home directory that [*GDAL*](https://gdal.org/) (one of the installed packages) will use to redirect the login appropriately for remote file access. It also creates a new or appends to an existing `.netrc` file in the user's home directory to include the login id and password (see [security risks](#Potential-Security-Risks) below). In principle, this notebook should only need to be run once to set thes files up, but can be rerun if needed. Further steps outlined below are required for programs to use this information."

If your acount is reasonably secure and you are using a password **_unique_** to this login, then this may be a reasonable risk (i.e, only your NASA Earth Data account could be compromised). If you are concerned, delete the `~/.netrc` after each use and then regenerate each time as needed with this notebook.
