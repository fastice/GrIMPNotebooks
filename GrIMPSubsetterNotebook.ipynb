For the Sentinel-based velocity mosaics (0725, 0727, 0731), a user can select a box on a map and choose which components are downloaded (vv, vx, vy, ex, ey, dT) and saved to a netCDF file. Once the download is complete, users can [explore](#Visualizing-the-Data) the data by interactively selecting points that are plotted as time series. In the case of the TSX/OPT products (NSDIC-0481 & NSIDC-0646), given relatively small size of each box (~50-km-by-50-km), the full product \"box\" is downloaded. Because of the sparse nature of these boxes, only the the products associated with a single box can be downloaded at a time."

There are only a few use cases in which this mode would be preferred. For example, examining only a few points in a large subset **without** using `loadRemote`, so that as the data are input on the fly, only the chunks surrounding the points would be read.

    "With Dask you can use `numWorkers` to specify multiple parallel threads, which can speed up downloads. It can also cause the download to fail (with something that looks like a file not found error) if the server decides it's receiving too many concurrent requests. The criteria under which this happens are unclear, and whether it has to do with the number of connections, open files, etc. This means the results could differ for the type of data product/access. For example, downloading a large number of TSX files (many file open operations per unit time) might cause things to break before the case where large pieces are pulled from full ice sheet mosaics (files are held open for long periods). Beyond `numWorkers=8`, the point of diminishing returns is approached. In general, `numWorkers=4` will be fairly robust, and provide good performance. But you can experiment by setting `numWorkers` below.  Note: this discussion is most applicable to network reads. For local file systems, the speedup may be substantially less due to file contention."
